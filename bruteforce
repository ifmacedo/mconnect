Presentation:
Security vulnerability: Brute Force Attack.
Vulnerability Type: Incorrect Access Control.
Affected Component: Affected function on user's logon.
Software: mConnect MV.
Versions: 02.001.00, 2013.1.6.8 (discontinued).
Bussiness area: Health, Medicine.

Describe the bug/issue:
Information disclosure in Logon Page in MV's mConnect application v02.001.00 allows an attacker to know valid users from the application's database via brute force.

Have you searched the internet or Github for an answer?
Yes.

To Reproduce:
Create a list of usernames, which can be acquired over the internet and launch brute force attacks against the application, entering any password. Note that, for valid
users, the application returns "invalid password". For invalid users, the application returns "invalid user".

The differentiation between the responses of the application allows us to know valid users of the system.

Expected behavior:
Application returns a neutral response, not informing whether the user exists or not.

Additional context:
The procedure is to request a new CVE identifier when an vulnerability was previously considered fixed.
