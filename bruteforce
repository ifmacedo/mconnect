Presentation:
Security vulnerability: Brute Force Attack.
Vulnerability Type: Broken Authentication.
Affected Component: Affected function on user's logon.
Software: mConnect MV.
Versions: 02.001.00, 2013.1.6.8 (discontinued).
Bussiness area: Health, Medicine.

Describe the bug/issue:
Information disclosure in Logon Page of MV mConnect application v02.001.00 and 2013.1.6.8 allows an attacker to know valid users from the application's database via 
a brute force attack.

Have you searched the internet or Github for an answer?
Yes.

To Reproduce:
Create a list of usernames, which can be acquired over the internet and launch brute force attack against this application, entering any password. Note that, for valid
users, the application returns "invalid password". For invalid users, the application returns "invalid user".

The differentiation between the responses of the application allows a hacker to know valid users of the system and proced to the next level, a password brute force attack of
only valid users.

Expected behavior:
Application should return a neutral response, not informing whether a user exists or not and whether the password is invalid or not.

Additional context:
The procedure is to request a new CVE identifier when an vulnerability was previously considered fixed.
