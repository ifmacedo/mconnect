Describe the bug/issue:
Information disclosure in Logon Page of MV mConnect application v02.001.00 and 2013.1.6.8 allows an attacker to know valid users from the application's database via 
a brute force attack.

Have you searched the internet or Github for an answer?
Yes.

To Reproduce:
Enumeration - Create a list of usernames, which can be acquired over the internet and launch a word list attack against the vulnerable application, entering any invalid password. Note that for valid
users, the application returns "invalid password". For invalid users, the application returns "invalid user".

The differences between the responses of the application allows a hacker to know valid users of the system and proced to the next level, a password brute force attack over
only valid users.

Expected behavior:
Application should return a neutral response, not informing if a user exists or not, nor if the password is invalid or not.

Bug Fix:
No bug fix. Discontinued software.

Additional context:
The procedure is to request a new CVE identifier when an vulnerability was previously considered fixed.

CVE ID: CVE-2020-23283
